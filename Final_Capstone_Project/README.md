# üöó Dynamic Pricing for Smart Parking ‚Äî Capstone Project

This project implements dynamic pricing strategies for smart parking lots using occupancy data, demand factors, and competitive pricing, along with a real-time pipeline for live price updates.

---

## üìö Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** for data preprocessing and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for EDA visualization
- **Pathway** for real-time data ingestion and streaming price computation
- **Bokeh** for optional interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** as the primary development environment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Flow

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**  
   - Read raw parking data.
   - Combine date & time into a timestamp.
   - Sort chronologically and clean invalid entries.
   - Generate a reduced dataset (`proessed_parking.csv`) with relevant features.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze occupancy, capacity, and time-series trends.
   - Identify patterns for price modeling.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Pricing Models**  
   - **Model 1:** Linear occupancy-based pricing.
   - **Model 2:** Demand-based dynamic pricing using occupancy, queue length, traffic, vehicle type, and special days.
   - **Model 3:** Competitive pricing with neighbor lot comparison and rerouting suggestions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-Time Pipeline (Pathway)**  
   - Ingest `parking_stream.csv` as a simulated data stream.
   - Compute live prices for Models 1 & 2.
   - Emit results to CSV for visualization or system integration.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualization**  
   - Offline: Time-series plots for model comparison.
   - Optional: Live updates with Bokeh or other dashboards.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Interpret model behaviors and suggest pricing strategies for city parking management.

## üìù Details of Pricing Models

- **Model 1:** Linear price increase with occupancy ‚Äî encourages early parking, deters parking when lots near full.
- **Model 2:** Dynamic pricing factoring queue length, traffic, vehicle type, and special days ‚Äî more context-aware.
- **Model 3:** Price adjustments based on nearby lots‚Äô prices + rerouting if lot is full ‚Äî balances supply and demand across locations.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open `SA_2025_FinalCapstoneProject.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
   - Execute cells sequentially for EDA, Models 1‚Äì3, and final plots.

2. **Check output:**
   - Plots of occupancy and price trends are generated in the notebook.

## üìå Recommendations

- Dynamic pricing helps distribute parking demand, reduce congestion, and improve revenue.
- Demand factors (queue, traffic, vehicle type) significantly improve pricing precision.
- Competitive pricing with rerouting can optimize occupancy city-wide.
